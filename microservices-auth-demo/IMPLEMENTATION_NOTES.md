# Implementation Notes

This document outlines how authorization is implemented in this microservices architecture.

## Overview

The project demonstrates a comprehensive approach to securing microservices using:

1. API Gateway pattern
2. JWT-based token authentication
3. Role-based access control
4. Service discovery with Eureka

## Authorization Flow

1. **Authentication Flow**:
   - User submits credentials to the Auth Service
   - Auth Service validates credentials
   - Auth Service generates a JWT containing user identity and roles
   - JWT is returned to the client

2. **Request Flow**:
   - Client includes JWT in Authorization header
   - API Gateway validates the token signature and expiration
   - If valid, API Gateway passes the request to the appropriate microservice
   - API Gateway adds user identity and roles as custom headers

3. **Service-Level Authorization**:
   - Each microservice extracts user information from headers
   - Service implements its own authorization logic based on roles
   - Service returns appropriate data or 403 Forbidden response

## Implementation Details

### API Gateway (Spring Cloud Gateway)

- Acts as the single entry point for all client requests
- Implements JWT validation as a global filter
- Routes requests to appropriate services
- Adds user identity information to requests as headers
- See `JwtAuthenticationFilter.java` in the API Gateway module

### Auth Service

- Handles user registration and authentication
- Manages JWT creation with embedded claims
- Uses Spring Security for authentication
- Contains service-specific role definitions
- See `AuthService.java` for the implementation

### Role-Based Access Control

Roles are defined as:
- `ROLE_USER` - Basic access
- `ROLE_ADMIN` - Administrative access
- `ROLE_CHAT_USER` - Chat service specific role
- `ROLE_CHAT_ADMIN` - Chat service admin role
- `ROLE_HRMS_USER` - HRMS service specific role
- `ROLE_HRMS_ADMIN` - HRMS service admin role
- `ROLE_MANAGER` - Manager role for HRMS

### Microservices JWT Validation

Each microservice:
- Validates the token signature
- Extracts user identity and roles
- Sets up Spring Security context
- Uses role-based annotations or programmatic checks for authorization

### Cross-Cutting Security Concerns

- Consistent JWT validation across services
- Same secret key used for token signing/validation
- Standard token format and claims structure
- Consistent error responses for unauthorized access

## Security Best Practices Implemented

1. **Token Security**:
   - Short token expiration time
   - Signed tokens to prevent tampering
   - No sensitive data in tokens

2. **API Security**:
   - Input validation
   - CSRF protection disabled (as tokens provide protection)
   - Proper error handling

3. **Infrastructure Security**:
   - Secure service-to-service communication
   - Service discovery with Eureka
   - Centralized authentication

## Potential Improvements

1. **Advanced Security**:
   - Refresh token implementation
   - Token revocation
   - Rate limiting

2. **Operational Improvements**:
   - Centralized configuration
   - Distributed tracing
   - Circuit breakers

3. **Security Hardening**:
   - Secret management with vault
   - Different signing keys per environment
   - More granular permissions model
